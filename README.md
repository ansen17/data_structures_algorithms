# Repository for data structures and algorithms 

I hope to do a few things in this repository:

  (1) Implement the basic data structures and algorithms from scratch in Python
  (2) Heavily comment rationale for relevant steps in the algorithm so it may be useful for others
  (3) If interested, explore creating a visual for these scripts
  (4) Refactor code so there is 1 file with separate helper functions and 1 with the actual implementation
