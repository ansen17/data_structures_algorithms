# Repository for data structures and algorithms 

I hope to do a few things in this repository:

  - Implement the basic data structures and algorithms from scratch in Python
  - Implement in java as well (primarily because I miss doing things in Java)
  - Heavily comment rationale for relevant steps in the algorithm so it may be useful for others
  - If interested, explore creating a visual for these scripts
  - Refactor code so there is 1 file with separate helper functions and 1 with the actual implementation
